    <p>Investing is putting your money to work for you through stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate. This allows your money to grow on its own if you make good investing decisions. Investing lets you make more money without having to work more hours of the day.</p>
    <p>Just to be clear, investing is not gambling, gambling is putting money on a risk by betting on an outcome that is not certain. Investing is much different, before you invest in something you put long and careful research into that which you are to be investing in.</p>
    <p>Investing has recently become more than just an interest or a hobby. Today investing in yourself is an important step to becoming financially stable and to maintain the same lifestyle during retirement. If you are successful with investing you can continue to earn a paycheck during retirement without having to work a steady job.</p>
    <p>This makes investing an essential part of life. Most likely a person will not work a job for most of their life then retire with a large pension anymore. Investing allows you more freedom from the worries of finances and more freedom in how you can live your life.</p>
