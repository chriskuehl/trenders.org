    <p>The stock market is a market for buying and selling portions of publicly-owned companies. A company is divided into a number of “shares”, which are just portions of a company. The more shares you own, the higher the percentage of the company you own.</p>
    <p>A stock exchange is a list of companies that you can buy or sell. There are two major stock exchanges in the United States:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</li>
      <li>The NASDAQ stock exchange</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Different companies belong to different stock exchanges. Apple, for example, is listed on the NASDAQ; ExxonMobil is on the NYSE.</p>
    <p>To help keep track of different companies, each company listed on the stock exchange is given a short term called a “ticker symbol”. This ticker symbol often resembles the company name. Apple’s ticker symbol is “AAPL”, while Microsoft’s is “MSFT”. Some names are harder to guess, like AT&T’s, which is T.</p>
    <p>Each company listed on a stock exchange has a value. This is the value of a single share of stock; you can think of it as a price to buy part of a company. The value of a share of stock for a given company fluctuates based on a number of factors. For example, if Apple reports that they earned more money in the previous quarter of the year than had been expected, the value of their stock will usually rise.</p>
    <p>In general, a company’s stock will go up when the company is doing well and down when the company is performing poorly.</p>
    <p>The goal of the stock market is to purchase shares of stock in a company when the value of that company is low. You then wait until you think the value of that company has peaked and sell the stock.</p>
    <p>For example, if John purchases 10 shares of stock in Google when it costs $500 per share, he will have to pay $5,000. After purchasing the stock, he waits a week for Google, and Google rises to $600 per share. He then sells all 10 shares of stock he purchased, and receives $600 per share. This gives him a total profit of $1,000 from his investment.</p>
    <p>Investments in the stock market should normally be viewed as long-term. Day trading (purchasing stock during the day and selling it the same day) can be dangerous since it requires you to gamble with large amounts of money. Over time, the stock market almost always increases in value.</p>
