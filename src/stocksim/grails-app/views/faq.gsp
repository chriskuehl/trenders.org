    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>Why and how is Wikipedia used?</h2><a id="wikipedia"></a>
    <p>We attempt to pull data from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> for companies you view. This allows us to give a good description of most companies on the stock exchange.</p>
    <p>Since Wikipedia can be edited by anybody, it's possible that data shown is inaccurate. In general, these inaccuracies are found quickly and fixed on Wikipedia itself. If you notice an inaccuracy, you should edit the Wikipedia article. After a few minutes, our cached version of the article will be refreshed to reflect your changes.</p>
    
    <h2>Why and how is Google News used?</h2><a id="google-news"></a>
    <p>We use <a target="_blank" href="http://news.google.com/">Google News'</a> public RSS feeds to show news articles on the home page, as well as news articles on company pages.</p>
    <p>To comply with <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/news/bin/news/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=40796">Google's requirements</a> for sites utilizing Google News RSS feeds, we always attribute news results to Google News, attribute the article providers, link to the article and to related articles, and provide the search term used to find the search results.</p>
