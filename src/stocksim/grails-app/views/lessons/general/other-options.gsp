    <p>Diversification is investing in several different types of investments. It is good practice to invest in diverse areas. Diversification reduces risk by allocating funds to multiple investments. Diversification is the most important component of reaching financial goals while risk remains low.</p>
    <p>One reason to diversify is because different stocks react differently to events. If you are invested in both a train company and an airline when people start switching to planes, you will not lose as much money when the train stock goes down but the airline rises as you would if you were invested only in the train company.</p>
    <p>Diversifying allows you to have a bit of a safety net if one of your investments fails. However it is important not to just diversify between companies but also between industries. You don’t just want to invest in lodging or just in technology just in case one of the sectors takes a large hit.</p>
    <p>Also you need to think about investing in different asset classes such as stocks and bonds, these different assets will react differently to events, much like the different industries might.</p>
    <p>Wide diversification is the best way to achieve your financial goals through investing, it allows you to be successful all around and prevents one investment’s failure to ruin your portfolio.</p>
