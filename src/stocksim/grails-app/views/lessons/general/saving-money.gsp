    <p>Saving is an important part of financial security. Saving allows you to store money for a large want or need. A person should always save 10% of their paycheck and should save until they have at least 6 months of living expenses in case an unexpected expense arises.</p>
    <p>When saving it is recommended to use a savings account at a bank. Savings accounts will allow you to store money in the bank and draw interest on the money in the bank. The amount of interest Varies between banks.</p>
    <p>Another way to use a bank to your advantage is to use a checking account to store money for daily expenses. A checking account accumulates little or no interest but allows you to use checks or a debit card. the money is drawn directly from your checking account.</p>
