    <h1>Choosing the Right Stocks</h1>

    <p>In general, the goal is to purchase a stock when it reaches a low point and then to sell it when it gains value. This is why it is generally a good idea to invest in companies that you think are going to do well in the future.</p>
    <p>The stock market reacts not only to how a company is performing but also to how it is expected to perform. If Apple is expected to earn $5 billion in a quarter, but they only earn $4 billion, this will usually result in the value of their stock falling, even if $4 billion is an increase from the previous quarter.</p>
    <p>Investing in a company right before a major event, such as investing in Apple before it is expected to reveal the latest iPad, is usually not a good idea. The stock price is often inflated since everybody else had the same idea as you and decided to purchase, and even if the new iPad is impressive, the stock likely will not rise much, and may even deflate over the next few days.</p>
    <p>The key factor in a company’s stock value is the demand for that value. If lots of people are selling the stock, then the price will drop. If lots of people are buying, then the price will rise since there is demand for it. The price of stocks is governed by the principle of supply and demand.</p>
    <p>For first-time investors, there is an easy way to determine the relative values of two stocks. This method is based on the idea that companies of similar size in the same industry tend to be worth the same amount.</p>
    <p>Some companies are divided into more shares of stock, so you can’t simply compare the price of a share of stock to see which company is worth more; in fact, you don’t want to invest in a company just because it is worth more than another. Instead, you want to try to invest in companies that are undervalued, because they are likely to see their price rise until they are properly valued.</p>
